# Windows terminal settings settings.json file backup

A backup repository I created to be able to share my windows-terminal setup across machines while keeping track of any changes I made.

### Installation instructions

```Run updateConfig.bat
It will backup your current configuration and just symlink to this locally cloned repo.
```

### updateConfig.bat dependencies
```mklink```

### Shell dependencies
```gsudo```
